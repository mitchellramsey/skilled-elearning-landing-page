## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge helped me refresh the basic concepts of flexbox, media queries, and other basic CSS principles. I recently just accepted a new position where I will be working heavily in the front-end development which is not what I do today. This challenge is just helping me get that "ring rust" off so I am coming in with a good mindset in a couple of weeks!

### Continued development

I think I would like to tackle this challenge again as a static React app. There is definitely many spots where I see different components within this layout. 

I would also like to use a different CSS library like SASS.
